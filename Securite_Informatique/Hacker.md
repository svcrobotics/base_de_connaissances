------

Many of my aspiring hackers have written to me asking the same thing. "What skills do I need to be a good hacker?"

As  the hacker is among the most skilled information technology  disciplines, it requires a wide knowledge of IT technologies and  techniques. To truly be a great hacker, one must master many skills.  Don't be discouraged if you don't have all the skills I list here, but  rather use this list as a starting ground for what you need to study and  master in the near future.

This  is my overview list of required skills to enter the pantheon of this  elite IT profession. I've broken the skills into three categories to  help you go from one rung to the other more easily—fundamental,  intermediate, and intangible skills—and have included links to related  articles on Null Byte for you to get acquainted with.

## The Fundamental Skills

These  are the basics that every hacker should know before even trying to  hack. Once you have a good grasp on everything in this section, you can  move into the intermediary level.

## 1Basic Computer Skills

It  probably goes without saying that to become a hacker you need some  basic computer skills. These skills go beyond the ability to create a  Word document or cruise the Internet. You need to be able to use the  command line in Windows, edit the registry, and set up your networking  parameters.

Many of these basic skills can be acquired in a basic computer skills course like A+.

## 2Networking Skills

You need to understand the basics of networking, such as the following.

- DHCP
- NAT
- Subnetting
- IPv4
- IPv6
- Public v Private IP
- DNS
- Routers and switches
- VLANs
- OSI model
- MAC addressing
- ARP

As  we are often exploiting these technologies, the better you understand  how they work, the more successful you will be. Note that I did not  write the two guides below, but they are very informative and cover some  of the networking basics mentioned above.

- [Hacker Fundamentals: A Tale of Two Standards](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/news/hacker-fundamentals-tale-two-standards-0133727/)
- [The Everyman's Guide to How Network Packets Are Routed](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hacker-fundamentals-everymans-guide-network-packets-are-routed-across-web-0134491/)

## 3Linux Skills

It  is extremely critical to develop Linux skills to become a hacker.  Nearly all the tools we use as a hacker are developed for Linux and  Linux gives us capabilities that we don't have using Windows.

If  you need to improve your Linux skills, or you're just getting started  with Linux, check out my Linux series for beginners below.

- [Linux Basics for the Aspiring Hacker](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/linux-basics/)

## 4Wireshark or Tcpdump

Wireshark  is the most widely used sniffer/protocol analyzer, while tcpdump is a  command line sniffer/protocol analyzer. Both can be extraordinarily  useful in analyzing TCP/IP traffic and attacks.

- [Wireshark Filters for Wiretappers](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/news/8-wireshark-filters-every-wiretapper-uses-spy-web-conversations-and-surfing-habits-0134508/)

## 5Virtualization

You need to become proficient in using one of the virtualization software packages such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) or [VMWare Workstation](http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation).  Ideally, you need a safe environment to practice your hacks before you  take them out in real world. A virtual environment provides you a safe  environment to test and refine your hacks before going live with them.

## 6Security Concepts & Technologies

A  good hacker understands security concepts and technologies. The only  way to overcome the roadblocks established by the security admins is to  be familiar with them. The hacker must understand such things as PKI  (public key infrastructure), SSL (secure sockets layer), IDS (intrusion  detection system), firewalls, etc.

The beginner hacker can acquire many of these skills in a basic security course such as Security+.

- [How to Read & Write Snort Rules to Evade an IDS](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/snort/)

## 7Wireless Technologies

In  order to be able to hack wireless, you must first understand how it  works. Things like the encryption algorithms (WEP, WPA, WPA2), the  four-way handshake, and WPS. In addition, understanding such as things  as the protocol for connection and authentication and the legal  constraints on wireless technologies.

To get started, check out my  guide below on getting started with wireless terms and technologies,  then read our collection of Wi-Fi hacking guides for further information  on each kind of encryption algorithms and for examples of how each hack  works.

- [The Aspiring Hacker's Guide to Hacking Wi-Fi](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/wi-fi-hacking/)

## The Intermediate Skills

This  is where things get interesting, and where you really start to get a  feel for your capabilities as a hacker. Knowing all of these will allow  you to advance to more intuitive hacks where you are calling all the  shots—not some other hacker.

## 8Scripting

Without [scripting skills](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/scripting/),  the hacker will be relegated to using other hackers' tools. This limits  your effectiveness. Every day a new tool is in existence loses  effectiveness as security admins come up with defenses.

To develop  your own unique tools, you will need to become proficient at least in  one of the scripting languages including the BASH shell. These should  include one of Perl, Python, or Ruby.

## 9Database Skills

If you want to be able to proficiently [hack databases](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/db-hacking/),  you will need to understand databases and how they work. This includes  the SQL language. I would also recommend the mastery of one of the major  DBMS's such SQL Server, Oracle, or MySQL.

- [Extracting Data from Online Databases Using Sqlmap](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hack-databases-extracting-data-from-online-databases-using-sqlmap-0150688/)

## 10Web Applications

Web  applications are probably the most fertile ground for hackers in recent  years. The more you understand about how web applications work and the  databases behind them, the more successful you will be. In addition, you  will likely need to build your own website for phishing and other  nefarious purposes.

## 11Forensics

To  become good hacker, you must not be caught! You can't become a pro  hacker sitting in a prison cell for 5 years. The more you know about [digital forensics](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/forensics/), the better you can become at avoiding and evading detection.

## 12Advanced TCP/IP

The  beginner hacker must understand TCP/IP basics, but to rise to the  intermediate level, you must understand in intimate details the TCP/IP  protocol stack and fields. These include how each of the fields (flags,  window, df, tos, seq, ack, etc.) in both the TCP and IP packet can be  manipulated and used against the victim system to enable MitM attacks,  among other things.

## 13Cryptography

Although  one doesn't need to be a cryptographer to be a good hacker, the more  you understand the strengths and weaknesses of each cryptographic  algorithm, the better the chances of defeating it. In addition,  cryptography can used by the hacker to hide their activities and evade  detection.

## 14Reverse Engineering

Reverse  engineering enables you to open a piece of malware and re-build it with  additional features and capabilities. Just like in software  engineering, no one builds a new application from scratch. Nearly every  new exploit or malware uses components from other existing malware.

In  addition, reverse engineering enables the hacker to take an existing  exploit and change its signature so that it can fly past IDS and [AV detection](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/evading-av-software/).

## The Intangible Skills

Along with all these computer skills, the successful hacker must have some intangible skills. These include the following.

## 15Think Creatively

There  is ALWAYS a way to hack a system and many ways to accomplish it. A good  hacker can think creatively of multiple approaches to the same hack.

- [CryptoLocker: An Innovative & Creative Hack](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/forum/cryptolocker-innovative-creative-hack-0151753/)

## 16Problem-Solving Skills

A  hacker is always coming up against seemingly unsolvable problems. This  requires that the hacker be accustomed to thinking analytically and  solving problems. This often demands that the hacker diagnose accurately  what is wrong and then break the problem down into separate components.  This is one of those abilities that comes with many hours of practice.

- [Problem Solving Is an Essential Hacker Skill](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/forum/problem-solving-is-essential-hacker-skill-0150882/)

## 17Persistence

A  hacker must be persistent. If you fail at first, try again. If that  fails, come up with a new approach and try again. It is only with a  persistence that you will be able to hack the most secured systems.
